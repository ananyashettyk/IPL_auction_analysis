# IPL_auction_analysis

This project aims to develop an auction strategy for a new IPL franchise by analyzing past IPL data to create a strong and balanced squad. 

The project involves:
- Analyzing player data to identify key players to target in the auction
- Creating a list of 10 players to bid on for each category (aggressive batsmen, anchor batsmen, hard-hitters, economical bowlers, wicket-taking bowlers, all-rounders, and wicketkeepers)
- Defining criteria for selecting the best players in each category
- Creating visual representations (graphs, tables, and charts) to present to team management before the auction

The project also includes additional questions for final assessment, which involve querying and analyzing the IPL data to extract insights on:
- Cities that have hosted IPL matches
- Boundary and dot ball statistics
- Dismissal kinds
- Extra runs conceded by bowlers
- Runs scored at each venue
- Year-wise runs scored at Eden Gardens
